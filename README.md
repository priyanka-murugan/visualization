# Netflix Content Data Visualization

(This was the final project submission for the course BAX-431 Data Visualization.
I have included the data cleaning steps that was conducted as a group but only 
included the visualisation that I had personally developed for the hypothesis I had come up with.)

## Introduction ##
Through this exploratory exercise, we want to build visualizations that showcase how content
(Movies/TV shows) hosted on Netflix has progressed over the years. This will tell our users the popularity
of content based on their genres and geography. These insights can help content producers understand
their target audience and preferences in what they consume. Since Netflix is not just a streaming service
anymore but they have also been producing original content in recent years, our conclusions can thus
prove to be instrumental in driving content that works well with the audience. This can also help Netflix
fine-tune its recommendations based on trends in content consumption in different consumer segments.


## Hypothesis: More content is added during the Holiday period in the Americas and Europe ##

We see a slow start for Netflix over several years. Things began to pick up in 2015, with a rapid increase
from 2016 for both movies and TV Shows. However, we see a much more rapid growth for movies than
shows. Content additions slowed down in 2020, likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
We see that December and July have the highest number of content added, which also coincides with the
winter and summer vacation period, where people will be directed towards watching online content. This
will be helpful for our users like Netflix and Content producers to know so they can add more relevant
content based on their target audience during this period.

We observe that the Americas region has the highest number of content added over the months, with the
highest during December, July, and September. The months of December and July are vacation periods;
hence our consumers would watch more content online therefore, our users can develop more content that
can be streamed during those months. We can see a content slump in February for the Americas. Similarly
for the Asia region, we see an uptick in December, April and March. While for Europe, Oceania and
Africa regions we do not necessarily see a pattern for specific months with an almost equal amount of
content added over the months. Based on our hypothesis, we do see strong evidence for the Americas
region but not for Europe
